## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- JavaScript 
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt more about DOM manipulation, and how to access different html attributes and css properties using javascript.

### Continued development
There is no plan to continue developing this project. However, the experience I gained building this will continue to help me in the next few projects I plan on completing.

### Useful resources
I found W3Schools useful for creating the accordion.
